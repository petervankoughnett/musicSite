    <h1 class='lessons'>Lessons</h1>
    <p class=lessons>I'm accepting students of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities.  The only requirement is that you have to want to play! I can teach piano: classical up to intermediate, jazz up to expert, just about anything else you&#39;re interested in learning.  I can teach folk and country guitar up to intermediate level.  I'm interested in teaching around your interests whether that&#39;s help learning to read music, learning some basic guitar chords, learning jazz improvisation, or learning to play and sing your favorite songs.  I'll build the lessons around your needs and desires.
    I want to make the lessons affordable but also make enough to be fair to myself so I charge a broad sliding scale of $10-60 per lesson.  If you can't afford to pay much, then don't feel bad about paying on the lower end.  If you can afford it, I definitely ask people to pay towards the higher end to help keep lessons affordable to everyone.</p>
