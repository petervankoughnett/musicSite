        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Music has been a central part of my life since an early age.  I began playing the piano and recently have        started playing the guitar and the accordion. My interests are as broad as my dad's record collection. I play jazz, blues,folk,                country, rock, and am always ready to learn something new.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My recent work includes an noise-jazz trio called Lucky Express, a string of increasingly competent              basement guitar recordings, and a solo piano album entitled &quot;Catching the Clouds.&quot;  Currently, I'm working on my first                studio album, &quot;Singer in the Ring by the Fire,&quot; which features group arrangements of some of the guitar songs I've written        over the last few years. We are in the rehearsing process and hope to release the album in late winter or early spring.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I play music to bring people together: leading sing-alongs, playing for community shows and events, and          playing original concerts.  My goals are to get my music out there and heard, bring people together, and to share what I know.                Please be in touch with any and all question, comments, inquiries, requests or ideas for projects.
